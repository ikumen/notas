## ðŸ’¡ **This page is just brain dump of raw ideas, feel free to add to it** ðŸ’¡

## What

* markdown based note-taking web app
* support tags
* support search of title, content, tags
* minimal editing experience (check out dev.to for example)
* edit/preview modes (maybe side by side)
* signin with OAuth (e.g openid connect)
* categories?
* (future) export/archive to github gist, dropbox, download?
* (future) think about OT (operational transformations) for colab editing

## How

**I'm putting these out there to give us some direction, something concrete to discuss. Nothing is set in stone, I'm open to suggestions** 

* Python backend (leaning toward [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) or Flask)
* TypeScript (and JS) frontend (leaning toward [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), maybe Vue, React)
* Azure (App Service, Functions, CosmosDB)
* Redis for an inverted index implementation for simple search

## Why

* looking for a new job soon, want to have a new project showcasing skills for tech I'm interested in working in
